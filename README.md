# Dynamics of Specialization in Neural Modules under Ressource Constraints

## Introduction

Here, you will find a self-contained implementation of the code needed to create and train modular neural-networks, with varying levels of structural modularity, to reproduce results and finding from https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02626.

## Installation
You will need to create a new environement, install requirements and install the dynspec package locally 
''
conda create -n dynspec python
conda activate dynspec
pip install -e .
''
You will also need to install the correct pytorch version for your system, head over to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
